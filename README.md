This .cmd file is a Client Downloader that I might continue updating it's just a project that I made because I got bored.

Questions that probally will be asked

Q: "Are these clients safe"
-----------------------------------------------------
A: "These clients are safe if it says I checked them"

Q: "Is the .cmd file ratted"
-----------------------------------------------------
A: "No, I have no fucking reason to rat a minecraft "hacked" client downloader, I only made this for efficiency. If you seriously think its ratted it's open source look at it yourself"

Q: "Can I make my own version of this"
-----------------------------------------------------
A: "Yes"
